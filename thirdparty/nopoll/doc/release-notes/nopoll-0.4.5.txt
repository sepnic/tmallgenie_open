                   --== noPoll toolkit ==--
                    Excuse me while I run
                           0.4.5

Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce a new stable
release of the noPoll toolkit.

noPoll is a OpenSource WebSocket implementation (RFC 6455), written in
ANSI C, that allows building pure WebSocket solutions or to provide
WebSocket support to existing TCP oriented applications.

Commercially supported, noPoll was written to have a clean, easy to
use and integrate library. It is released under the terms of LGPL 2.1
(so you can build OpenSource or commercial applications) and currently
is being heavily used by Vortex Library, Turbulence and Core-Admin to
provide WebSocket support to those projects (some of them using BEEP
over WebSocket).

This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - New stable release with several corrections.

Thanks to
~~~~~~~~~

  - Florian Fainelli (reported and fixed clash with isset, sys/param.h
    for OpenWrt/LEDE).

  - Camille Oudot (reported and fixed use EVP_MD_CTX as opaque type).

  - github.com/@jackyzy823 (reported avoid allocating when WinSocket
    fails to init and "masking" ping according to role).

  - github.com/@rfish001 (reported Fixed wrong listener7 check at reg
    tests).


Changes from previous release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Updated config.mk.example to include linking indications for
  windows platform.
  
* [fix] Updated nopoll-regression-client.c to define ETIMEDOUT in case it is not
  available (windows platform).
  
* [fix] Fixed compilation failure (nopoll_listener.c) while compiling on windows
  and having debug disabled.
  
* Add .gitignore file

* [fix] Avoid clashes with isset() from sys/param.h (Reported and
  fixed by florian.fainelli). Merge pull request #26 from
  ffainelli/param.  Add .gitignore and avoid clashes with sys/param.h
  isset while building with an external toolchain for OpenWrt/LEDE
  (reported and fixed by Florian Fainelli
  https://github.com/ffainelli).
  
* [fix] Corrected nopoll_conn_flush_writes documentation (wrong time indication
  and explain better reported values).

* [fix] Making nopoll_conn_flush_writes to also check for EWOULD_EINPROGRESS to
  avoid insisting.

* [fix] Making nopoll_conn_send_frame to clear conn->pending_write_added_header 
  to 0 when it is detected enough was written to include the header so calls to
  nopoll_conn_flush_writes do not reporting bytes (user land) considering those
  bytes twice. 

* [fix] Improved nopoll-regression-client (test-04-c) to avoid calling
  to flush pending writes when there's nothing and to check that
  pending + written equals to requested in order to signal precisely
  what's happening. Making the code to also report this values so
  developer can see what's going on.

* [fix] openssl 1.1: use EVP_MD_CTX as opaque type (fixed by
  camille.oudot). Merge pull request #27 from
  camilleoudot/compat_openssl_1.1. openssl 1.1: use EVP_MD_CTX as
  opaque type (OpenSSL 1.1 API change fix by github.com/camilleoudot
  @camilleoudot ).

* [fix] Making nopoll_conn_opts_new to setup result->ssl_protocol with
  the default higher TLS method available.

* [fix] Several updates to nopoll_conn module to make tls flexible
  method available in those platforms with OpenSSL 1.1.0, trying to
  remove rest of the deprecated apis to avoid compilation problems..

* [fix] Updated nopoll-regression-client.c to better detect and
  deprecate TLS flexible API (debian stretch)

* [fix] Fixing compilation errors at debian lenny..

* [fix] Making nopoll_ctx_new to avoid allocating when WinSocket fails
  to init (Reported by github.com/jackyzy823 Closes
  https://github.com/ASPLes/nopoll/issues/29).

* [fix] fixed wrong reference to NOPOLL_METHOD_TLSV1_2
  (NOPOLL_METHOD_TLSV2).

* [fix] Fixed wrong listener7 (port 1240 running tlsv12) check. Closes
  https://github.com/ASPLes/nopoll/issues/30 Reported by
  https://github.com/rfish001

* [fix] Fixed PING frames to support ping frames with 0 payload.
  Closes https://github.com/ASPLes/nopoll/issues/31

* [fix] Updated nopoll_conn_log_ssl to detect known errors to report
  better error messages.

* [fix] Updated TLS method selection to report (log) what is the
  method selected. Updated code to use by default flexible and
  stronger selection algorithms

* [fix] Reorganised ping frame handling to automatically respond when
  using message based API (nopoll_msg_get_next) not only stream based
  API.
  
* [fix] Fixed nopoll_conn_send_ping. Added regression test (test_02-b)
  to check ping support.

* [fix] Updated client regression test to include new test (test-02-b)
  to test client side ping support.
  
* [fix] Updated client regression test to avoid checking sslv23 when
  Openssl is too new.

* [fix] updated nopoll-regression-common.h to include additional
  headers required by test19 reg test.

* [fix] Updated documentation recommendation about FD_SETSIZE..

* [fix] Updated nopoll_io_wait_select_add_to code to detect when
  FD_SETSIZE is about to be reached to avoid breaking but reporting
  error.

* [fix] Updated nopoll_conn_send_ping to flag "masked" according to
  role. Reported by https://github.com/jackyzy823

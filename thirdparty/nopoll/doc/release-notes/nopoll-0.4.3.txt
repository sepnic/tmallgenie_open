                           0.4.3

Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce a new stable
release of the noPoll toolkit.

noPoll is a OpenSource WebSocket implementation (RFC 6455), written in
ANSI C, that allows building pure WebSocket solutions or to provide
WebSocket support to existing TCP oriented applications.

Commercially supported, noPoll was written to have a clean, easy to
use and integrate library. It is released under the terms of LGPL 2.1
(so you can build OpenSource or commercial applications) and currently
is being heavily used by Vortex Library, Turbulence and Core-Admin to
provide WebSocket support to those projects (some of them using BEEP
over WebSocket).

This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Added IPv6 support

  - Updated DNS code to use thread safe and newer getaddrinfo

Thanks to
~~~~~~~~~

  - Javier Celaya & Sergio Lopez (provided patch for connection
    functions reusing already connected socket).

Changes from previous release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Added buffer size indication when cookie ending char fails..

* [fix] Increased default nopoll buffer size to process incoming
  handshakes from 1024 to 8192. Created variable to better control
  this from nopoll_decl.h

* [fix] Several updates applied to nopoll-conn module to add client
  support for IPv6. Added two new APIs and reorganized internal code
  to share as much as possible:

  - nopoll_conn_new6
  - nopoll_conn_tls_new6

* [fix] Updated DNS/host resolution code to use getaddrinfo (),
  removing all calls to gethostbyname (to avoid possible race
  conditions).

* [fix] Updated nopoll-listener module to include support for
  IPv6. Added several new APIs:

   - nopoll_listener_new6
   - nopoll_listener_new_opts6
   - nopoll_listener_tls_new6
   - nopoll_listener_tls_new_opts6

* [fix] Updated nopoll-listener module to replace code calling to
  gethostbyname by newer, thread safe, getaddrinfo...

* [fix] Updated noPoll regression test to check new funcitons for IPv6
  support. Everything working and valgrind checked..

* [fix] Added new definition to support Transports (ipv4 and ipv6)..

* [fix] Fixed minor changes to build nopoll for freebsd..

* [fix] API to open websocket with existing socket (sergio.lopez). Add
  two functions, nopoll_conn_new_with_socket and
  nopoll_conn_tls_new_with_socket, to open a websocket connection over
  an already existing socket.
